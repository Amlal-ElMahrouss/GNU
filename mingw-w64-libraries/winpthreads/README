The Winpthreads Library
-----------------------

This library provides POSIX threading APIs for mingw-w64.

Programs are usually linked against the winpthreads DLL, and winpthreads
headers expose `dllimport` APIs by default. When linking against the
static library, especially when building a user DLL with libtool, it is
necessary to define the `WINPTHREAD_STATIC` macro to avoid undefined
references.
